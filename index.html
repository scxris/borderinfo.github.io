 <p> <font face="Uni Sans Heavy"> The PMEBGE Discord is a fun and wonderful community aslong as you follow their rules!
   It is highly suggested not to post any nsfw content, and other bad stuff, as it will indeed result in a perm blacklist or such.
   If you'd like to join their discord, here is the invite: <A href="https://discord.gg/bordr"> </a> </font> </p>
